This was just something I threw together in about 10 hours to demonstrate
my DHTML skills and to test a hypothesis that such a thing was possible.
This isn't much more than an engine for toddling around a map and getting
your butt kicked, but its a proof-of-concept that could be extended or
munged around by someone with more free time than myself.
